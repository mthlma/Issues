Issues:

- Fingerprint sensor

List Of Things You Have Tried To Do To Try And Resolve This Error: 
Sensors:
- Set correct permissions on "init.mmi.rc" inside rootdir folder for sensors, by kanging https://github.com/dotOS-Devices/device_motorola_potter/blob/dot11/rootdir/etc/init.mmi.rc
- Link vendor/firmware/sensorhubfw.bin (path was wrong before)
- Fix denials related to sensorhub on sepolicy
- Add missing sensor related lines on BoardConfig.mk and device.mk (https://github.com/mthlma/android_device_motorola_potter-lineage-18.1/commit/30e1a049d91a64f83eab8d779ce132019cfb1c4d)
- Import configs (https://github.com/mthlma/android_device_motorola_potter-lineage-18.1/tree/lineage-18.1/configs/sensors)
- I tried to make it copy only motosh on device.mk, but with no success as well
Audio:
- I tried this commit: https://github.com/dotOS-Devices/device_motorola_potter/commit/5d5638449700b9d287da12e16bb62f3ae9469d2c
- I deleted some configs that I didn't see in other trees but that makes headphones to not work and doesn't fix my issue
- I saw on logs there was a service for android.hardware.audio.service, but correct version was 2.0 so I tried to build android.hardware.audio-@2.0.service, I but it was still building wrong audio service. I can try this again later
Camera:
- I tried to take some camera blobs from https://github.com/JarlPenguin/proprietary_vendor_motorola-1 (I saw deen blobs in similar devices)
- I tried to kang missing blobs, but it was just asking more and more on logs (I can make a build later if it's the case)
Fingerprint:
- Tried to use same ones from sanders, as it's a similar device https://github.com/mthlma/device_motorola_sanders
- It was working before somehow, but it decided to not work anymore, I don't know why
General: 
- I tried to look everything on kernel side, based on old kernel (https://github.com/dotOS-Devices/android_kernel_motorola_potter) but everything seems already merged
